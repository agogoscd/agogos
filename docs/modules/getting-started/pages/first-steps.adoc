It's great to see your interest in Agogos!

[#cli]
== CLI

We suggest to install `agogosctl` -- the Agogos CLI in the first place. You
will need it for example to install and run Agogos or to interact with it later.

We provide the `agogosctl` binary to download from our CI:

[source,bash]
----
❯ curl -L "https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/agogos/agogos/-/jobs/artifacts/main/raw/cli/target/agogosctl?job=cli" -o agogosctl
❯ chmod +x agogosctl
----

TIP: We suggest to place the `agogosctl` binary on your `PATH`.

NOTE: Currently the binary size may be quite big. We will try to optimize it.

[source,bash]
----
❯ agogosctl --help
Usage: agogosctl [-hV] [-o=<output>] [COMMAND]
  -h, --help              Show this help message and exit.
  -o, --output=<output>   Output format, valid values: plain, yaml, json,
                            default: plain.
  -V, --version           Print version information and exit.
