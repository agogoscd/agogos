= Event Trigger

include::common:partial$draft.adoc[]

#TODO#

Event triggers use the
link:https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md[CEL expression expression language]
to decide whether the trigger should be fired.

The decision whether to fire the trigger or not is happening
once the expression is evaluated. A trigger is fired only when the expression
returns `true`.

.Example of a CloudEvent build trigger
[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - event:
      cel: "body.component.spec.builder == 'maven' && body.component.spec.data.source.url.contains('github.com')"
----

[TIP]
====
You can use the `kubectl` command with the `-o json` switch to obtain relevant
resources to have better understanding how to craft your CEL expression.
