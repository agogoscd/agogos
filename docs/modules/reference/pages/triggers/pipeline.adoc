= Pipeline Run Trigger

include::common:partial$draft.adoc[]

Pipeline triggers are used when we want to perform an action after a particular
Pipeline finishes successfully.

Common use case for Pipeline triggers is chaining of Pipelines.

.Example of a Pipeline trigger

  events:
    - pipeline:
        name: p1
  target:

In above example the `p2` Pipeline will be run after the
`p1` Pipeline finishes.
