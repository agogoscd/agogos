A Component build trigger can be used to trigger a resource after a build of a
specific Component is finished and we know exactly what is the Component name.

.Example of a Component build trigger
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agogos.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: component-to-component
spec:
  events:
    - component:
        name: "one"
  target:
    kind: Component
    name: two
----

In above example the `two` Component build will be started
when a build of Component `one` is finished.
