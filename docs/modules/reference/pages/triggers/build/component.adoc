= Component Name Filter Trigger

TIP: Read more about the xref:concepts:components.adoc[_Component_ concept].

_Component_ triggers are a type of xref:reference:triggers/build/index.adoc[_Component Build_ triggers].

A _Component_ name trigger can be used in case we want to run a _Pipeline_ after a build is finished
of a specific _Component_ and we know it's name.

.Example of a Component build trigger
[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - build:
      component: "one"
----

In above example the pipeline will be triggered when a build of _Component_ `one` is finished.
