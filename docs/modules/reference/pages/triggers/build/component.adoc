TIP: Read more about the xref:concepts:components.adoc[_Component_ concept].

NOTE: This Trigger is part of xref:reference:triggers/build/index.adoc[Component Build triggers].

A _Component_ name trigger can be used to trigger a resource after a build of a specific _Component_ is finished and we know exactly
what is the _Component_ name.

.Example of a Component name build trigger
[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - build:
      component: "one"
----

In above example the resource will be triggered when a build of _Component_ `one` is finished.
