= Group Name Filter Build Trigger

include::common:partial$draft.adoc[]

TIP: Read more about the xref:concepts:groups.adoc[_Group_ concept].

NOTE: This Trigger is part of xref:reference:triggers/build/index.adoc[Component Build triggers].
_Group_ name triggers are similar to _Component_ name triggers. Group name triggers
can be used in case there is a _Group_ defined and we want to trigger the pipeline
if any of the _Components_ referenced in the _Group_ should trigger the pipeline.

.Example of a Component Group build trigger
[source,yaml]
----
triggers:
  - build:
      group: "group1"
----

In above example the pipeline will be triggered when a build of any _Component_ referenced
in the `group1` _Group_ is finished.

Assuming the `group1` _Group_ will have two _Components_ referenced: `one` and `two`,
the pipeline will be triggered when either a build of the _Component_ `one` or the
 _Component_ `two` finishes.

WARNING:    See xref:reference:triggers/index#multiple-triggers[note about multiple triggers].
            _Group_ name build triggers are implemented as multiple _Component_ name
            triggers internally.
