= Group Build Trigger

[NOTE]
====
This Trigger is part of
xref:reference:triggers/build/index.adoc[Build triggers].
====

Group triggers are similar to
xref:reference:triggers/build/component.adoc[Component triggers].
Group triggers can be used in case there is a Group
defined and we want to trigger the pipeline if any of the Components
referenced in this Group should trigger the pipeline.

.Example of a Group build trigger
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agogos.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: group-to-pipeline
spec:
  events:
    - group:
        name: g1
  target:
    kind: Pipeline
    name: p1
----

In above example the pipeline will be triggered when a build of any Component
referenced in the `g1` Group is finished.

Assuming the `g1` Group will have two Components referenced: `c1` and `c2`,
the `p1` Pipeline will be triggered when either a build of the Component `c1`
or the Component `c2` finishes.

[WARNING]
====
See the
xref:reference:triggers/overview.adoc#multiple-triggers[note about multiple triggers].
Group name build triggers are implemented as multiple Component
triggers internally.
