= CloudEvent Listener Build Trigger

[NOTE]
====
This Trigger is part of
xref:reference:triggers/build/index.adoc[Build triggers].
====

The CloudEvent Listener (CEL) trigger is a variation of the
xref:triggers/event.adoc[Event trigger]
which is evaluated on the payload of the successful
xref:events/agogos.adoc#componentbuild-events[Component Build CloudEvent].

.Example of a CEL build trigger
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: agogos.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: Trigger
metadata:
  name: build-to-component
spec:
  events:
    - build:
        filter: "body.component.metadata.name == 'cpaas-test-brew-rpm'"
  target:
    kind: Pipeline
    name: p1
----

In the above example, the trigger will be fired when the Component uses the
`brew` Builder and the data that is passed to the Builder contains `type` set
to `bundle`. Any Build of a Component that satisfies this requirement will
trigger the resource.

[TIP]
====
You can use the `kubectl` command with the `-o json` switch to get the relevant
Component and Component Build data to have a better understanding of how
to craft your CEL expression.
