= Build Triggers

include::common:partial$draft.adoc[]

Build Triggers are a way to define what action should be performed in case of
a successful Build event.

There are different ways how such triggers can be defined. Correct usage depends on the use case.
It can be as generic or as detailed as the user wants.

We can watch builds of a specific Component. Or a Group
a Component belongs to. Finally, we can utilize link:https://github.com/google/cel-spec/blob/master/doc/langdef.md[CEL expressions]
to have full control.

Below table should help with the decision which Component build trigger is the right one to use.

|Useful when we have important Components within the system for which builds
some actions should be performed.

Using Component build triggers is a common use case in case of small number of
Components and Pipelines as well.

Component build triggers are a good starting point.

|Group name
|xref:triggers/build/group.adoc[Group]
a|Useful when the are Pipelines that work on the same set of Components. In such case it
is convenient to put all relevant Components into a Group and reference this Group in Trigger.

NOTE: Builds of any Components from the Group will trigger the Pipeline.

[TIP]
====
To have fine-grained control over which Build triggers some action the xref:triggers/build/cel.adoc[CEL Build] Trigger could be used.

This is useful when we do not know the name of the Component or Group that is related to the Build,
but at the same time we know that Component or Build metadata contains required information.
