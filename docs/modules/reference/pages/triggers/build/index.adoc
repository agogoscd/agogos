= Successful Build Triggers

WARNING: #TODO#

Successful _Build_ triggers are defined inside of the `build` section.

// TODO: Probably builds and pipelines and not only pipelines

_Pipeline_ can be triggered after a _Component_ build is finished. We can identify which builds should trigger
which pipelines by defining component build triggers.

There are different ways how such triggers can be defined. Correct usage depends on the use case.
It can be as generic or as detailed as the user wants.

We can watch builds of a specific _Component_. Or a _Component Group_
a _Component_ belongs to. Finally, we can utilize link:https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath[JSONPath]
to have full control over source of a component build.

Below table should help with the decision which Component build trigger is the right one to use.

|Build differentiator
|Usage

|_Component_ name 
|Useful when the pipeline works only on one _Component_ (or just a few) and we know exactly what _Components_ we want.

This is the most common use case in case of small number of _Components_ and _Pipelines_. This is a good starting point.

|Group name
a|Useful when the are _Pipelines_ that work on the same set of _Components_. In such case it is convenient to
put all _Components_ into a _Group_ and reference this _Group_.

NOTE: Builds of any _Components_ from the _Group_ will trigger the _Pipeline_.

|JSONPath
|To have fine-grained control over which _Component Build_ triggers the _Pipeline_.

This is useful when we do not know the name of the _Component_ or _Group_ that is related to the _Build_,
but at the same time we know that _Component_ or _Component Build_ metadata contains required information.
