= Agogos

Agogos is a platform created by the CPaaS team and other contributors within
Red{nbsp}Hat. Agogos is offered to Red{nbsp}Hat product teams to
automate their productization processes.

Agogos is a build and delivery orchestrator for Red{nbsp}Hat products. It
automates tasks for many Red Hat internal services. Some of the systems Agogos
uses are: Brew (building), Jira (bug tracking), Bugzilla (bug tracking), Errata
Tool (delivery), Index Image Builder (delivery), and Dist-Git (source code).â€‹
Agogos does not build, test, or release Red{nbsp}Hat products directly, it uses
these services instead.
