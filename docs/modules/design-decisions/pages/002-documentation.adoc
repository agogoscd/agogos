= Agogos Documentation

Documentation is key to have a good user and developer experience.

== Goals
* Have simple documentation using plain language and a consistent style
* Have instructions for the users to complete Agogos tasks 
* Have guidelines to the developers to contribute to Agogos
* Auto-generate as much as possible from the Agogos code (CLI, Schemas...)
* Provide in depth explanations of Agogos concepts
* Keep a record of design decisions

== What/How
* Agogos documentation is written as AsciiDoc files and kept in the same
repository as the code. These files are used to generate the HTML site using
GitLab pages and Antora.
* Agogos has documentation guidelines to keep a consistent style (distilled
from https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style)
* Agogos has a single documentation site
* Agogos has clear separation between concepts, procedures and references (see
https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs/#_creating_modules)
* Agogos has automatic generation of CLI/Schema references
* Agogos has a dedicated section for the design decisions. Those documents aim
to inform future development so the project keeps its vision.

== Consequences
Benefits:

* Better user and developer experience
* Code and documentation are versioned together
* Design decisions are recorded and are accessible

Drawbacks:

* Style guide has to be written
* Contribution threshold is higher due to style and structure requirements
* Review is more expensive due to style and structure requirements
