= 001 - Agogos

**Status**: DRAFT
**Date**: 2023-04-14

== Why
CPaaS (Continuous Productization as a Service) has a series of limitations in its
design and technology mainly:

* CPaaS does not have a centralized view
* Jenkins design is enforced on CPaaS, so development and testing is slow
* CPaaS is not flexible enough and enforce too much

== What/How
The CPaaS team decided to create a new iteration of the CPaaS service, called
"Agogos" (**pipeline** in Greek). Agogos...:

* uses of Red{nbsp}Hat technologies: Quarkus, Tekton and OpenShift
* does not have a custom UI: it relies on Kubernetes objects and the Tekton UI
* wraps Tekton using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
* is a Kubernetes Operator: keeps state and performs validation on CRDs
* has a small codebase: it contains the core resources, business logic is external
  to the Agogos core
* provides flexibility for users, while still complies with Red{nbsp}Hat policies.

== Consequences
Main benefits of Agogos:

* Its underlying technologies make ask for support and features easier.
* Its development is easier and faster.
* Its ecosystem is modern.
* Allows for a modularity, where each business component is isolated.
* Allows for user customization, while some processes are enforced.

Main drawbacks of Agogos:

* Is tied to Kubernetes
* Requires sync and validation of contracts that external components need to
  comply with
