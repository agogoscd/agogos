= Groups

Agogos' Groups are resources that define Agogos' Pipelines, Component and Groups.
A resource defining a Group looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
---
kind: Group
metadata:
  name: my-group
spec:
  components: [component-a, component-b]
  pipelines: [pipeline-a, pipeline-b]
  groups: [group-a, group-b]
----

== Executions
Agogos' Executions are resources that represent the execution of a Group defined
resources. When an Execution is processed, Builds are created for Components,
Runs are created for Pipelines, and Executions are created for Groups.

[WARNING]
====
Do not create Executions directly as there are intermediate steps that need to
happen. See
xref:submissions.adoc[].

A resource file defining an Execution looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
---
kind: Execution
metadata:
  generateName: my-group-
spec:
  group: my-group
