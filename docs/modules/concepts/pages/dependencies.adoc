= Dependencies

Agogos' Components, Pipelines and Groups can define dependents Components, Pipelines
and Groups. The key where dependents should be defined is named `dependents` and
it looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
---
kind: Component/Pipeline/Group
metadata:
  name: my-component/pipeline/group
spec:
  ...
  dependents:
    components: [component-a]
    pipeline: [pipeline-a]
    group: [group-a]
  ...
----

When the Build, Run or Execution of the resource completes, a `Dependency`
object is created. Then the Dependency resource is processed and dependents'
Builds, Runs or Executions get created. This process is repeated until the last
resource defines no dependents.
