= Submissions

Agogos' Submissions are resources that reference an Agogos Pipeline, Group or
Component. When a Submission is created, depending on the Agogos resource
type they are referencing, it triggers the creation of another Agogos Resources.
If a Submission references a Component, it triggers the creation of a Build. If
a Submission references a Pipeline, it triggers the creation of a Run. If a
Submission references a Group, it triggers the creation of an Execution.
