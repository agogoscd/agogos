= Builders

include::common:partial$draft.adoc[]

Builders are responsible for building xref:components.adoc[Components].

Builders registered in the system influence what Component types
can be added to the system.

Builders define schema for a Component so that it can be accepted by the Builder.
This means that if a Component uses a particular Builder
it's definition needs to pass the schema validation defined by the Builder.
