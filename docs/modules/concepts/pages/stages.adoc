= Stages

== About Stages

Stages are organized into directories exposing the phase when
a particular stage can be run.

We can find following phases:

* build
* test
* deliver

The build phase is responsible for turning the source code and component metadata
into an artifact.

Test phase is responsible for making sure the artifact meets the required criteria.

Deliver phase makes the artifact available for consumption.

== Build Stages (Builders)

Builders are concepts responsible for converting some input into Artifacts.
It's up to the Builder to define what is the correct input and what is the output.

Example Builders could be: Podman, Brew, PNC, Maven, and so on.
