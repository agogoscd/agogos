= Source Handlers

include::common:partial$draft.adoc[]

Source Handlers are responsible for providing the source of a xref:components.adoc[Component]
so that it can be used xref:builders.adoc[Builder].

In most cases Source Handlers will fetch the source code from a repository, but it's not a
requirement.
