== Scope
This page provides the AsciiDoc documentation style guidelines for
the Agogos system. Agogos is the Continuous Productization (CP) automated
build and delivery system for Red{nbsp}Hat products.

This document describes the formatting conventions used for the AsciiDoc
text files. For information on AsciiDoc syntax, see the
link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference]
page.

== AsciiDoc Writer's Guide
The
link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc Writer's Guide]
contains an excellent overview of creating AsciiDoc files and all the syntax
available for them. While it does not address style directly, it does contain
some useful conventions, which are included here for easier reference.

=== Admonitions
An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to auxiliary information.
The five admonition types supported in AsciiDoc are:
NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, WARNING, and CAUTION.

Each has a specific purpose when added to a document:

* Use NOTE or TIP to add additional information that may be useful to
  the reader.
* Use IMPORTANT to highlight information that might be easily overlooked and
  may cause unnecessary frustration for the reader.
* Use CAUTION to advise the reader to act carefully (i.e., exercise care).
* Use WARNING to inform the reader of danger, harm, or consequences that exist.

Admonitions that span multiple lines should use _blocks_ with _delimiters_
to contain the contents. Admonition blocks are defined like so:

----
[NOTE]
====
This is an example of an admonition block.
Unlike an admonition paragraph, it may contain any AsciiDoc content.
====
----

=== Delimiters
From "Building Blocks in AsciiDoc" in the AsciiDoc Writer's Guide:

[IMPORTANT]
====
AsciiDoc allows delimited lines to be longer than 4 characters. *Donâ€™t do it*.
Maintaining long delimiter lines is a colossal waste of time, not to mention
arbitrary and error prone. Use the minimum line length required to create a
delimited block and move on to drafting the content. The reader will never see
the long delimiters anyway since they are not carried over to the output.
====

=== Numbered Lists
Number lists in AsciiDoc can use a list of items prefixed with a number-dot,
like this:

----
1. Protons
2. Electrons
3. Neutrons
----

But, since the numbering is obvious, the AsciiDoc processor will insert the
numbers for you if you omit them:

----
. Protons
. Electrons
. Neutrons
----

will produce:

. Protons
. Electrons
. Neutrons

If you decide to use numbers for your ordered list, *you have to keep them
sequential*. Thus, it is preferred that the numbers be omitted and the
actual list numbering be left to the AsciiDoc formatter.

== Red{nbsp}Hat AsciiDoc Mark-up Conventions
The
https://redhat-documentation.github.io/asciidoc-markup-conventions/[AsciiDoc Mark-up Quick Reference for Red{nbsp}Hat Documentation]
contains a set of conventions used in the Agogos documents. Rather than repeat
them all here, please reference the document directly.

There is one convention included here to be aware of that is buried in the
Quick Reference Guide - _product names_. The Guide indicates that the company
name and product names should be separated by a `+{nbsp}+` (non-breaking space)
to prevent them from line breaking when displayed. So, whenever "Red{nbsp}Hat"
or a product name is included in the text, it should be written as:

   Red{nbsp}Hat

== Agogos Mark-up Conventions
Agogos has adopted additional mark-up conventions to standardize the look of the
files and simplify reviews. The main reason for most of these conventions is
that the team *uses GitLab for reviewing changes*. Since reviews on GitLab
merge requests are designed for code, not documentation, this limits the users
when providing feedback on AsciiDoc file updates.

=== Line Length and Line Breaks
Limit the length of text lines in the file to 80 characters.
This is to make commenting easier when the documentation is reviewed.

*Exceptions*: Links, code blocks, and console contents are not expected to
be restricted to 80 characters.

=== Links
Links and the link text should be on lines by themselves.
Link URLs tend to be long, so even by themselves links will exceed the 80
character limit. They also tend to need updating more frequently, so finding
and reviewing changes is easier if they are on a line by themselves.

=== Code Samples
Code samples should include a source highlighting tag. This tag will enable
source code syntax highlighting. Here is the text of an example of some
source code with a tag:

----
 [source,yaml]
 ----
 release:
   pipelines:
     - name: "my-timed-release-trigger-pipeline"
       triggers:
         - type: "timed"
           cron: "H H(22-23) * * 1"
 ----
----

This text will render as:

[source,yaml]
----
release:
  pipelines:
    - name: "my-timed-release-trigger-pipeline"
      triggers:
        - type: "timed"
          cron: "H H(22-23) * * 1"
----

The Agogos documentation uses the highlight.js source highlighter. A list of
the supported syntax codes for highlight.js is available on the
link:https://highlightjs.org/[highlight.js web site].

=== Admonition Blocks
Any admonition that contains more than a single line of text should use a
delimited block. This is to to make the admonitions easier to recognize
and edit in the text. The block also allows any AsciiDoc content, so the
admonition can contain additional formatting to support the content.
Here is an example of the text for an admonition in a delimited block:

----
[NOTE]
====
This is an example of an admonition block.
Unlike an admonition paragraph, it may contain any AsciiDoc content.
====
----

This text produces the following admonition:

[NOTE]
====
This is an example of an admonition block.
Unlike an admonition paragraph, it may contain any AsciiDoc content.
====

=== Tables
The AsciiDoc approach to tables are explained in a section of the
link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/#a-new-perspective-on-tables[AsciiDoc Writers Guide].
AsciiDoc is pretty flexible when comes to text formatting of tables,
but the preferred option is to treat them as
"...a delimited block that contains one or more bulleted lists.
The list marker is a vertical bar (|).
Each list represents one row in the table..."

While AsciiDoc supports converting textual tables into render specific
table syntax, using textual tables makes future editing difficult as
the spacing of all the other rows may need adjustment when long items of text
are added.

Here is an example of the preferred text format for a table:

----
.Project Definition Keys
[width="99%",cols="3m,^2e,10",options="header"]
|====
|Key
|Required?
|Description

|name
|yes
|The name of the project.

|components
|yes
|List of components in this project.

|owners
|
|List of owners for the project.
 _Owners should be listed as Red{nbsp}Hat email addresses._

|====
----

Which renders like this:

.Project Definition Keys
[width="99%",cols="3m,^2e,10",options="header"]
|====
|Key
|Required?
|Description

|name
|yes
|The name of the project.

|components
|yes
|List of components in this project.

|owners
|
|List of owners for the project.
 _Owners should be listed as Red{nbsp}Hat email addresses._
