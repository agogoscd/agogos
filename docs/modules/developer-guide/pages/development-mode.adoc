// include::common:partial$draft.adoc[]

Here you will find on how to run Agogos in development mode which will make it easy to
contribute to Agogos!

== Kubernetes Cluster

To be able to deploy Agogos you need to have a Kubernetes cluster where
it can be deployed.
If you don't have a cluster you maintain which could be used to deploy Agogos, you can
use Minikube.

TIP: If you use Minikube, see the xref:environment.adoc#managing-kubernetes-contexts[note about managing contexts].

[#minikube]
=== Minikube

Recommended version:: Latest
Documentation:: link:https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[Official installation guide].

You may want to assign more resources to your installation. In case you use `kvm2`
driver you could use this command:

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ minikube start --driver=kvm2 --cpus=4 --memory=6g --disk-size=30GB
----

==== Tips

[#managing-kubernetes-contexts]
===== Managing contexts

You can maintain the minikube context in a separate kubeconfig file.

This will make it possible to switch to Minikube context by setting an environment variable.
Run the below command to create (or update) your minikube context in specified file.

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/minikube.yaml
‚ùØ minikube update-context
üéâ  "minikube" context has been updated to point to 192.168.39.112:8443
üíó  Current context is "minikube"
----

To use the Minikube context you will need to run `export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/minikube.yaml`
in the terminal before interacting with the cluster.

==== Known issues

This section describes known issues and limitations with the setup.

===== Failure to call webhooks due to a refused connection

An error appears because your firewall blocks the connection between Kubernetes
running in Minikube and Agogos Webhooks application running outside of Minikube.

Running the following command will fix the issue.

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=libvirt --add-port=8443/tcp
----

NOTE: The `--permanent` option activates after restarting your system.

== Installing Agogos in Development Mode

To be able to develop Agogos you need to install it in the `dev` mode. This will register
resources within the cluster, but it will make it possible to run Agogos components outside
of the cluster.

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ agogosctl adm install --profile dev
----

[NOTE]
====
Please note that installing Agogos using the `agogosctl` CLI will ensure proper dependencies
are installed automatically.

This includes:

* Tekton Pipelines
* Tekton Triggers
* Knative Eventing
====

Development mode prepares certificates that are required to secure
communication between Kubernetes and Webhooks application.

The install process will print all required information.

== Running Agogos Operator in Development Mode

You can run the Operator in dev mode that enables live coding using:

[source,bash]
.Running the Operator
----
‚ùØ ./mvnw quarkus:dev -pl operator -am
----

After running this command you should see the Agogos Operator running.

This page provides a useful development UI available at http://localhost:7070/q/dev/ as well!
====

=== Setting Up Broker Port Forwarding

To be able to publish CloudEvents we need to expose the Broker outside of the cluster.
The `kubectl port-forward` command could be used to achieve this goal.

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ kubectl port-forward service/broker-ingress 8111:80 -n knative-eventing
----

== Running Agogos Webhooks in Development Mode

To run Webhooks application you need to run this command:

[NOTE]
====
We assume here that you have checked out the code at the `~/agogos` path. If this
is not the case, replace it with the proper one.
====

[source,bash]
.Running Webhooks
----
‚ùØ QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_FILE=~/agogos/cli/target/webhooks.crt QUARKUS_HTTP_SSL_CERTIFICATE_KEY_FILE=~/agogos/cli/target/key.pem ./mvnw clean quarkus:dev -pl webhooks -am -Dquarkus.http.host=0.0.0.0
----

After running this command you should see the Agogos Webhooks running.
