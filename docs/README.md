# Agogos Documentation

Agogos is the Continuous Productization (CP) automated build and delivery
system for Red Hat products.
The hosted shared service can be compared to
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) or
[Circle-CI](https://circleci.com/).
The high level idea is to have an entry point to get Red Hat product teams
integrated with continuous productization to release Red Hat products.
